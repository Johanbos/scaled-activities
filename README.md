# scaled-activities
This repository can be seen as a boilerplate repository when finished. There may be open [issues](https://github.com/Johanbos/scaled-activities/issues), so take a loot at them after forking.

My goal is to run activities in the smallest timespan possible (and also charge your creditcard with the same rate ðŸš€ be carefull).

## Criteria for my goal:
- Touch 1 million resources / objects
- Each activity is ACID
- Pay per use

## No green, no joy!
